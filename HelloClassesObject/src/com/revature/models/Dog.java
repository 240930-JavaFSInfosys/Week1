/* Dog EXTENDS Animal... So what?

First of all, this is a primary example of INHERITANCE (one of the 4 pillars of OOP)
This means that the Dog Class has ALL the members of the Animal Class (variables and methods)
It is now a SUBCLASS of Animal, AKA Child Class.
    -This is an "IS-A" relationship. A Dog IS-A Animal.
Dog can also have its own unique members that Animal doesn't have
*/
public class Dog extends Animal{

    //TODO: some unique dog-specific variables

    //TODO: one unique dog-specific method

    /*TODO: method overriding and method overloading
     (Examples of Polymorphism which is another pillar of OOP)  

     */

}
